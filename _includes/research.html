              Decision Invariant Optimization (Xcurve Framework)

              Recently, machine learning and deep learning technologies have been successfully employed in many complicated high-stake decision-making applications such as disease prediction, fraud detection, outlier detection, and criminal justice sentencing. All these applications share a common trait known as risk-aversion in economics and finance terminologies. In other words, the decision-makers tend to have an extremely low risk tolerance. Under this context, the decision-makers will carefully choose their decision parameter to meet the specific requirement. Consequently, the decision parameters for train and test might be quite different. To mitigate the decision parameter shift problem, I'm seeking for new decision-invariant machine learning machanisms, on top of which we develop a new framework called <a href="https://xcurveopt.github.io/"></a>.

              The goal of X-curve learning is to learn high-quality models that can adapt to different decision conditions. Inspired by the fundamental principle of the well-known AUC optimization, our library provides a systematic solution to optimize the area under different kinds of performance curves. To be more specific, the performance curve is formed by a plot of two performance functions $x(\lambda)$$, $y(\lambda)$$ of decision parameter $\lambda$. The area under a performance curve becomes the integral of the performance over all possible choices of different decision conditions. In this way, the learning systems are only required to optimize a decision-invariant metric to avoid the risk aversion issue.
