    - title: Decision Invariant Optimization (Xcurve Framework)
      description: 
      'Recently, machine learning and deep learning technologies have been successfully employed in many complicated high-stake decision-making applications such as disease prediction, fraud detection, outlier detection, and criminal justice sentencing. All these applications share a common trait known as risk-aversion in economics and finance terminologies. In other words, the decision-makers tend to have an extremely low risk tolerance. Under this context, the decision-makers will carefully choose their decision parameter to meet the specific requirement. Consequently, the decision parameters for train- and test- might be quite different. To mitigate the decision parameter shift problem,  I'm seeking for new decision-invariant machine learning machanisms , on top of which we develop a new framework called [Xcurve](https://xcurveopt.github.io/).
      
      The goal of X-curve learning is to learn high-quality models that can adapt to different decision conditions. Inspired by the fundamental principle of the well-known AUC optimization, our library provides a systematic solution to optimize the area under different kinds of performance curves. To be more specific, the performance curve is formed by a plot of two performance functions $$x(\lambda)$$, $$y(\lambda)$$ of decision parameter $$\lambda$$. The area under a performance curve becomes the integral of the performance over all possible choices of different decision conditions. In this way, the learning systems are only required to optimize a decision-invariant metric to avoid the risk aversion issue'
