                  The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a crucial metric for machine learning, which evaluates the average performance over all possible
                  True Positive Rates (TPRs) and False Positive
                  Rates (FPRs). Based on the knowledge that a
                  skillful classifier should simultaneously embrace
                  a high TPR and a low FPR, we turn to study a
                  more general variant called Two-way Partial AUC
                  (TPAUC), where only the region with TPR ≥
                  α, FPR ≤ β is included in the area. Moreover, a
                  recent work shows that the TPAUC is essentially
                  inconsistent with the existing Partial AUC metrics
                  where only the FPR range is restricted, opening
                  a new problem to seek solutions to leverage high
                  TPAUC. Motivated by this, we present the first
                  trial in this paper to optimize this new metric. The
                  critical challenge along this course lies in the difficulty of performing gradient-based optimization
                  with end-to-end stochastic training, even with a
                  proper choice of surrogate loss. To address this issue, we propose a generic framework to construct
                  surrogate optimization problems, which supports
                  efficient end-to-end training with deep-learning.
                  Moreover, our theoretical analyses show that: 1)
                  the objective function of the surrogate problems
                  will achieve an upper bound of the original problem under mild conditions, and 2) optimizing the
                  surrogate problems leads to good generalization
                  performance in terms of TPAUC with a high probability. Finally, empirical studies over several
                  benchmark datasets speak to the efficacy of our framework.

                    Data exhibited with multiple modalities are ubiquitous in real-world clustering
                    tasks. Most existing methods, however, pose a strong assumption that the pairing
                    information for modalities is available for all instances. In this paper, we consider
                    a more challenging task where each instance is represented in only one modality,
                    which we call mixed-modal data. Without any extra pairing supervision across
                    modalities, it is difficult to find a universal semantic space for all of them. To tackle
                    this problem, we present an adversarial learning framework for clustering with
                    mixed-modal data. Instead of transforming all the samples into a joint modalityindependent space, our framework learns the mappings across individual modality
                    spaces by virtue of cycle-consistency. Through these mappings, we could easily
                    unify all the samples into a single modality space and perform the clustering.
                    Evaluations on several real-world mixed-modal datasets could demonstrate the
                    superiority of our proposed framework.
